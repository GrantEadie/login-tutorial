Audia Pulse

 

A web application that attempts to combine the basics of synthesis and audio engineering with a visual analog, demonstrating the various effects of sound in space and time and how small changes in a handful of parameters can change the output data.

 



Use Case:

 

Any one who has been interested in the fundamentals of sound can open this application and understand what is happening. The idea is to allow users a bit of theory using visualization and demonstration, then move to an open field of possibilities. Essentially an interactive museum of little sound components, each with the ability to save and share.

 



Minimum Viable Product:

 

·             Four playable, fully modular synthesizers with a variety of parameters

·             A timeline or transport for the user to move

·             Multiple visualizations, equipped with custom parameters

·             A login and saving feature

 

Tools for the MVP:

 

·             React/Redux

·             Firebase

·             Web Audio API

·             Javascript

·             HTML/CSS/SCSS

·             Vercel

·             p5.js

·             Tone.js

·             three.js

 

Additional Features:

 

·             More detailed parameters for audio and visualization

·             Sharing feature

·             Download feature

·             Effects output and modulation

·             Midi input

·             iOS implementation

 

Additional Features Tools:

                 

·             Facebook/Google/Twitter/Github Authentication

·             React Native

 

I’m genuinely very excited about the possibilities with this project. They are effectively endless from every direction. I hope to have a final product that will blow some minds.
